    """Synchronization object used in a solution of so-called second
    readers-writers problem. In this problem, many readers can simultaneously
    access a share, and a writer has an exclusive access to this share.
    Additionally, the following constraints should be met:
    1) no reader should be kept waiting if the share is currently opened for
        reading unless a writer is also waiting for the share,
    2) no writer should be kept waiting for the share longer than absolutely
        necessary.

    The implementation is based on [1, secs. 4.2.2, 4.2.6, 4.2.7]
    with a modification -- adding an additional lock (C{self.__readers_queue})
    -- in accordance with [2].

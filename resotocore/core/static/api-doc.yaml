                This endpoint is used by worker nodes which can perform work.
                A worker would use this endpoint to establish a websocket connection and register the tasks
                that can be performed by the worker. One worker can perform one or more tasks over one connection.

                In case the connection is lost, all outstanding tasks are rescheduled to other workers.
                This means the local tasks queue should be wiped in case of connection loss.

                Note: the server tries to spread the number of tasks evenly over the number of workers.
                This number is derived by the number of outstanding messages in the queue irrelevant which tasks
                are outstanding.

                            type: string
                -   name: filter
                    description: |
                        Additional properties to filter tasks of provided task name.
                        The value of the parameter is either a string or a list of strings separated by comma.
                        The available filter criteria are defined by the specific task to execute.

                        All specified filter criteria need to match by the task to execute.
                        If a list of values is defined for a filter criteria, at least one needs to match.
                        (e.g. cloud=aws,gcp would match a task for cloud=aws).

                        Example:
                                 The worker is able to perform tasks of type tag, but only for cloud AWS:
                                 cloud=aws

                                 The worker is able to perform tasks of type tag, for AWS and GCP:
                                 cloud=aws,gcp

                                 Maybe the worker is only capable to perform the work in a specific account.
                                 cloud=aws&account=123 could be specified to only filter for tasks in this cloud in this
                                 account.

                        In case there are multiple workers that match the task criteria, the most specific
                        worker is taken.

                        Example:
                                worker1: cloud=aws,gcp
                                worker2: cloud=aws account=123

                        If the task is for cloud=aws and account=123, then only worker2 would get the task to execute
                        not worker1.

                        A simple query is usually fine.
                        A complex query might be acceptable in certain cases. Maybe an index can be used to make this query simple?
                        A bad query is usually something where an index is missing or the query has to be rewritten.

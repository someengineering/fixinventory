                            "description": "For workforce identities, rely on an identity provider that enables you to manage identities in a centralized place. This makes it easier to manage access across multiple applications and services, because you are creating, managing, and revoking access from a single location. For example, if someone leaves your organization, you can revoke access for all applications and services (including AWS) from one location. This reduces the need for multiple credentials and provides an opportunity to integrate with existing human resources (HR) processes. For federation with individual AWS accounts, you can use centralized identities for AWS with a SAML 2.0-based provider with AWS Identity and Access Management. You can use any provider— whether hosted by you in AWS, external to AWS, or supplied by the AWS Partner—that is compatible with the SAML 2.0 protocol. You can use federation between your AWS account and your chosen provider to grant a user or application access to call AWS API operations by using a SAML assertion to get temporary security credentials. Web-based single sign-on is also supported, allowing users to sign in to the AWS Management Console from your sign in website. For federation to multiple accounts in your AWS Organizations, you can configure your identity source in AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) (IAM Identity Center), and specify where your users and groups are stored. Once configured, your identity provider is your source of truth, and information can be synchronized using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) v2.0 protocol. You can then look up users or groups and grant them IAM Identity Center access to AWS accounts, cloud applications, or both. IAM Identity Center integrates with AWS Organizations, which enables you to configure your identity provider once and then grant access to existing and new accounts managed in your organization. IAM Identity Center provides you with a default store, which you can use to manage your users and groups. If you choose to use the IAM Identity Center store, create your users and groups and assign their level of access to your AWS accounts and applications, keeping in mind the best practice of least privilege. Alternatively, you can choose to Connect to Your External Identity Provider using SAML 2.0, or Connect to Your Microsoft AD Directory using AWS Directory Service. Once configured, you can sign into the AWS Management Console, or the AWS mobile app, by authenticating through your central identity provider. For managing end-users or consumers of your workloads, such as a mobile app, you can use Amazon Cognito. It provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps. Your users can sign in directly with sign-in credentials, or through a third party, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, or Google.",

Use these groups and attributes to control access, rather than individual users.

A VPC allows you to define your network topology that spans an AWS Region with a private IPv4 address range that you set, or an IPv6 address range AWS selects. You should apply multiple controls with a defense in depth approach for both inbound and outbound traffic, including the use of security groups (stateful inspection firewall), Network ACLs, subnets, and route tables. Within a VPC, you can create subnets in an Availability Zone. Each subnet can have an associated route table that defines routing rules for managing the paths that traffic takes within the subnet. You can define an internet routable subnet by having a route that goes to an internet or NAT gateway attached to the VPC, or through another VPC.",

Conduct other activities, such as log analysis or analyzing disk images, in a dedicated security account with customized forensic workstations and tools accessible to your responders.Routinely ship relevant logs to a data store that provides high durability and integrity. Responders should have access to those logs.

You can fully automate identity management, network security, data protection, and monitoring capabilities and deliver them using popular software development methods that you already have in place. When you build security automation, your system can monitor, review, and initiate a response, rather than having people monitor your security position and manually react to events. An effective way to automatically provide searchable and relevant log data across AWS services to your incident responders is to enable Amazon Detective.If your incident response teams continue to respond to alerts in the same way, they risk alert fatigue. Over time, the team can become desensitized to alerts and can either make mistakes handling ordinary situations or miss unusual alerts. Automation helps avoid alert fatigue by using functions that process the repetitive and ordinary alerts, leaving humans to handle the sensitive and unique incidents. Integrating anomaly detection systems, such as Amazon GuardDuty, AWS CloudTrail Insights, and Amazon CloudWatch Anomaly Detection, can reduce the burden of common threshold-based alerts.You can improve manual processes by programmatically automating steps in the process. After you define the remediation pattern to an event, you can decompose that pattern into actionable logic, and write the code to perform that logic. Responders can then execute that code to remediate the issue. Over time, you can automate more and more steps, and ultimately automatically handle whole classes of common incidents.For tools that execute within the operating system of your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, you should evaluate using the AWS Systems Manager Run Command, which enables you to remotely and securely administrate instances using an agent that you install on your Amazon EC2 instance operating system. It requires the Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent), which is installed by default on many Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Be aware, though, that once an instance has been compromised, no responses from tools or agents running on it should be considered trustworthy.",

These events should exercise responders using the same tools and techniques that would be used in a real-world scenario - even mimicking real-world environments. Game days are fundamentally about being prepared and iteratively improving your response capabilities. Some of the reasons you might find value in performing game day activities include:Validating readinessDeveloping confidence – learning from simulations and training staffFollowing compliance or contractual obligationsGenerating artifacts for accreditationBeing agile – incremental improvementBecoming faster and improving toolsRefining communication and escalationDeveloping comfort with the rare and the unexpectedFor these reasons, the value derived from participating in a simulation activity increases an organization's effectiveness during stressful events. Developing a simulation activity that is both realistic and beneficial can be a difficult exercise. Although testing your procedures or automation that handles well-understood events has certain advantages, it is just as valuable to participate in creative Security Incident Response Simulations (SIRS) activities to test yourself against the unexpected and continuously improve.Create custom simulations tailored to your environment, team, and tools. Find an issue and design your simulation around it. This could be something like a leaked credential, a server communicating with unwanted systems, or a misconfiguration that results in unauthorized exposure. Identify engineers who are familiar with your organization to create the scenario and another group to participate. The scenario should be realistic and challenging enough to be valuable. It should include the opportunity to get hands on with logging, notifications, escalations, and executing runbooks or automation. During the simulation, your responders should exercise their technical and organizational skills, and leaders should be involved to build their incident management skills. At the end of the simulation, celebrate the efforts of the team and look for ways to iterate, repeat, and expand into further simulations.AWS has created Incident Response Runbook templates that you can use not only to prepare your response efforts, but also as a basis for a simulation. When planning, a simulation can be broken into five phases.Evidence gathering: In this phase, a team will get alerts through various means, such as an internal ticketing system, alerts from monitoring tooling, anonymous tips, or even public news. Teams then start to review infrastructure and application logs to determine the source of the compromise. This step should also involve internal escalations and incident leadership. Once identified, teams move on to containing the incidentContain the incident: Teams will have determined there has been an incident and established the source of the compromise. Teams now should take action to contain it, for example, by disabling compromised credentials, isolating a compute resource, or revoking a role's permission.Eradicate the incident: Now that they've contained the incident, teams will work towards mitigating any vulnerabilities in applications or infrastructure configurations that were susceptible to the compromise. This could include rotating all credentials used for a workload, modifying Access Control Lists (ACLs) or changing network configurations.",

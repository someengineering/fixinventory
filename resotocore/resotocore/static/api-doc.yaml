        **Note this can not be tested from within swagger!**

        ## Authorization
        In case Resoto has a PSK infrastructure in place, the client needs to send a JWT token via the `Authorization` header
        or via the `resoto_authorization` cookie.
        It is also possible to omit header or cookie and send an Authorization message as first message on the websocket.
        Example
        { "kind": "authorization", "jwt": "Bearer <jwt>" }

        This endpoint is used by worker nodes which can perform work.
        A worker would use this endpoint to establish a websocket connection and register the tasks
        that can be performed by the worker. One worker can perform one or more tasks over one connection.

        In case the connection is lost, all outstanding tasks are rescheduled to other workers.
        This means the local tasks queue should be wiped in case of connection loss.

        Note: the server tries to spread the number of tasks evenly over the number of workers.
        This number is derived by the number of outstanding messages in the queue irrelevant which tasks
        are outstanding.

        - name: task

            Additional properties to filter tasks of provided task name.
            The value of the parameter is either a string or a list of strings separated by comma.
            The available filter criteria are defined by the specific task to execute.

            All specified filter criteria need to match by the task to execute.
            If a list of values is defined for a filter criteria, at least one needs to match.
            (e.g. cloud=aws,gcp would match a task for cloud=aws).

            Example:
                     The worker is able to perform tasks of type tag, but only for cloud AWS:
                     cloud=aws

                     The worker is able to perform tasks of type tag, for AWS and GCP:
                     cloud=aws,gcp

                     Maybe the worker is only capable to perform the work in a specific account.
                     cloud=aws&account=123 could be specified to only filter for tasks in this cloud in this
                     account.

            In case there are multiple workers that match the task criteria, the most specific
            worker is taken.

            Example:
                    worker1: cloud=aws,gcp
                    worker2: cloud=aws account=123

            If the task is for cloud=aws and account=123, then only worker2 would get the task to execute
            not worker1.
